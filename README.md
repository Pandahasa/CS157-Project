# CS157-Project

User Manual: 
The project files should contain everything needed,  just need to run two terminals. First terminal for the backend, go into the server directory and run ./mvnw spring-boot:run OR mvnw spring-boot:run (depending on operating system).
Then in the second terminal go to the client directory run: npm i (installs dependencies) then npm run dev and open up the browser → http://localhost:3000. NOTE: you need node package manager!
All credentials for the online db are already stored in application.properties in the backend. Also the tables and sample data are already created so while create_schema.sql and initialize_data.sql are provided for clarity, it isn’t necessary to run for setting up the project.
